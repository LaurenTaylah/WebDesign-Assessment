     <p> Rachael Ward (stage name RAYCH), is a trimester 4 audio production student at the Australian College of the Arts (Collarts). </p>
     <p> When Rachael isn’t studying, she enjoys writing her own music, recording covers and originals, listening to Paramore, attending festivals with her friends, and overall creating art she’s proud and passionate of. </p>
     <p> While progressing through her audio course, Rachael discovered a deeper love for recording and assisting with the producing of singles, EPs and albums with local clients in the surrounding Collingwood area. Her love for recording and dreams of becoming a producer, is what drove her to creating her audio recording business, under her musician stage name- Raych’s Audio Productions.  </p>
     <p> She hopes that by creating a website, she’ll be able to gain more clients and gain a deeper love, understanding and passion for music, both in a recording and performance space.  </p>
<p> Solo singer-songwriter from the south east suburbs of
  Melbourne, Rachael, has been playing and writing music since
  she was 13. Mixing indie pop vibes with acoustic and folk, she
  has created her own sound and lyrical aesthetic through her
  own life experiences and the experiences of those around her.
  Rachael grew up in a music loving family and got exposed to
  many different styles that lead her to wanting to write and
  record her own songs. From playing small gigs in high school to
  medium one&#39;s in Melbourne, she has a passion for live
  performance and a drive to make any audience feel emotion
  through her songwriting.</p>
